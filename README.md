## Install

> **Important**
> Make sure that `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.

```bash
sh -c "$(printf '%s\n install\n' "$(curl -fs 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saccarosium/shell-velocity/main/install.sh')")"
```

## Uninstall

```bash
sh -c "$(printf '%s\n remove\n' "$(curl -fs 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saccarosium/shell-velocity/main/install.sh')")"
```

## Usage

If you used the install script just run `man shv`. If you didn't you can read the documentation at `docs/shv.md`.

## Philosophy

> The reasoning behind Notational Velocity's present lack of multi-database support is that storing notes in separate databases would 1) Require the same kinds of decisions that category/folder-based organizers force upon their users (e.g., "Is this note going to be work-specific or home-specific?"), and 2) Defeat the point of instantaneous searching by requiring, ultimately, the user to repeat each search for every database in use.

By providing a default directory, we offer (one) fix to the first issue.

By searching the whole set of directories simultaneously, we handle the second.

It also handles Notational Velocity's issue with multiple databases. UNIX does not allow repeated filenames in the same folder, but often the parent folder provides context, like in `workout/TODO.md` and `coding/TODO.md`.
